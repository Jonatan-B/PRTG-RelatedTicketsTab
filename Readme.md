This is a javascript modification for PRTG. It adds a tab when you are on a sensor or device page and shows you related tickets. See below for example. The blackout parts were to not expose any private information.

For information on how to get this to work please see the official PRTG documentation <a href="https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/33-how-can-i-re-brand-and-customize-the-prtg-web-interface-using-css-and-javascript">here</a>.
